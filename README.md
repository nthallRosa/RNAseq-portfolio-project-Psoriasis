# RNAseq-portfolio-project---Psoriasis-and-co-morbidities
This repository contains a mini-portfolio project in which I use Dseq2 to analyze a bulk-RNAseq psoriasis dataset. The goal is to identify gene expression patterns that best characterize the disease and serve as predictors for development of future co-morbidities.
